# AI Product From Scratch

**Goal:** Understanding, not production.

This repository teaches AI product development by building a real Communication Mirror agent - a tool that analyzes the emotional impact of messages. You'll learn:

- How to structure multi-step AI reasoning
- Prompt engineering that actually works
- Local LLM integration with node-llama-cpp
- Building without frameworks (so you understand what's happening)

**Not included:** Production concerns, scalability, frameworks, deployment

**What you get:** Deep understanding of how AI agents work under the hood
